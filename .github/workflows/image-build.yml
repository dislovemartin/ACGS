# This workflow builds various Docker images for the project on every push and pull request.
# Its primary purpose is to validate that the Dockerfiles are correct and the images can be successfully built.
# These images are NOT pushed to a container registry by this workflow. Image pushing is handled by the main ci.yml workflow.
